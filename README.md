hesseldahlsound.com

This is the official website for hesseldahlsound.com — the personal audio mixing and mastering service of Mikkel Hesseldahl Konyher. The site is designed with a modern, dark aesthetic and written entirely in first-person, reflecting Mikkel’s solo operation.

Originally scaffolded using emergent.sh, the codebase was then refined and expanded by Mikkel to fit the specific needs of the business — visually, technically, and personally.
