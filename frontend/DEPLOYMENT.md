# Deployment Instructions

This document provides instructions for deploying the React application to various hosting providers while ensuring client-side routing works correctly.

## The Problem

Single-page applications (SPAs) built with React Router handle routing on the client side. When a user directly accesses a route (e.g., by typing the URL or refreshing the page), the server needs to be configured to serve the `index.html` file instead of returning a 404 error.

## Solution

We've included configuration files for various hosting providers in the `public` directory:

1. **Netlify** - `_redirects` file
2. **Apache Servers** (e.g., Simply.com) - `.htaccess` file
3. **IIS Servers** - `web.config` file
4. **Vercel** - `vercel.json` file

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the production-ready application.

### 2. Deploy to Your Hosting Provider

#### Netlify

- Drag and drop the `build` folder to Netlify's dashboard, or
- Connect your GitHub repository and configure Netlify to use the build command `npm run build` and publish directory `build`

The `_redirects` file will be automatically included in the deployment.

#### Simply.com or other Apache servers

1. Upload the contents of the `build` directory to your web server
2. Ensure the `.htaccess` file is included and properly uploaded
   - **Important**: Some FTP clients or deployment tools hide files starting with a dot (.) by default
   - Check your FTP client settings to show hidden files
   - If you still can't see or upload the `.htaccess` file, rename it to `htaccess.txt`, upload it, then rename it back to `.htaccess` on the server
3. Make sure your server has `mod_rewrite` enabled

#### IIS Servers

1. Upload the contents of the `build` directory to your IIS server
2. Ensure the `web.config` file is included and properly uploaded
3. Make sure URL Rewrite module is installed on your IIS server

#### Vercel

- Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, or
- Use the Vercel CLI to deploy: `vercel`

The `vercel.json` file will be automatically included in the deployment.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing 404 errors after deployment:

1. **Verify configuration files are included in the build**: Check that the appropriate configuration file for your hosting provider is present in the deployed files.

2. **Check server logs**: Server logs may provide more information about why the routing isn't working.

3. **Contact your hosting provider**: Some hosting providers may require specific configurations or have limitations on URL rewriting.

4. **Try a hash router**: If all else fails, you can use the provided HashRouter alternative:

```javascript
// In index.js, change:
import App from "./App";
// to:
import App from "./HashRouterApp";
```

This uses `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter`, which doesn't require server configuration but adds a `#` to your URLs (e.g., `example.com/#/about` instead of `example.com/about`).
